class SystemClient(object):
    """High-level client for generating requests for a beer-garden System.

    SystemClient creation:
        This class is intended to be the main way to create beer-garden requests. Create an
        instance with beer-garden connection information (optionally including a url_prefix) and
        a system name::

            client = SystemClient(host, port, 'example_system', ssl_enabled=True, url_prefix=None)

        Pass additional keyword arguments for more granularity:

            version_constraint:
                Allows specifying a particular system version. Can be a version literal ('1.0.0')
                or the special value 'latest.' Using 'latest' will allow the the SystemClient to
                retry a request if it fails due to a missing system (see Creating Requests).

            default_instance:
                The instance name to use when creating a request if no other instance name is
                specified. Since each request must be addressed to a specific instance this is a
                convenience to prevent needing to specify the 'default' instance for each request.

            always_update:
                Always attempt to reload the system definition before making a request. This is
                useful to ensure Requests are always made against the latest version of the system.
                If not set the System definition will be loaded once (upon making the first
                request) and then only reloaded if a Request fails.

    Loading the System:
        The System definition is lazily loaded, so nothing happens until the first attempt to send
        a Request. At that point the SystemClient will query beer-garden to get a system definition
        that matches the system_name and version_constraint. If no matching system can be found a
        FetchError will be raised. If always_update was set to True this will happen
        before making each request, not just the first.

    Making a Request:
        The standard way to create and send requests is by calling object attributes::

            request = client.example_command(param_1='example_param')

        In the normal case this will block until the request completes. Request completion is
        determined by periodically polling beer-garden to check the Request status. The time
        between polling requests starts at 0.5s and doubles each time the request has still not
        completed, up to max_delay. If a timeout was specified and the Request has not completed
        within that time a ``ConnectionTimeoutError`` will be raised.

        It is also possible to create the SystemClient in non-blocking mode by specifying
        blocking=False. In this case the request creation will immediately return a Future and
        will spawn a separate thread to poll for Request completion. The max_concurrent parameter
        is used to control the maximum threads available for polling.

        .. code-block:: python

            # Create a SystemClient with blocking=False
            client = SystemClient(host, port, 'example_system', ssl_enabled=True, blocking=False)

            # Create and send 5 requests without waiting for request completion
            futures = [client.example_command(param_1=number) for number in range(5)]

            # Now wait on all requests to complete
            concurrent.futures.wait(futures)

        If the request creation process fails (e.g. the command failed validation) and
        version_constraint is 'latest' then the SystemClient will check to see if a different
        version is available, and if so it will attempt to make the request on that version.
        This is so users of the SystemClient that don't necessarily care about the target system
        version don't need to be restarted if the target system is updated.

    Tweaking beer-garden Request Parameters:
        There are several parameters that control how beer-garden routes / processes a request. To
        denote these as intended for beer-garden itself (rather than a parameter to be passed to
        the Plugin) prepend a leading underscore to the argument name.

        Sending to another instance::

            request = client.example_command(_instance_name='instance_2', param_1='example_param')

        Request with a comment::

            request = client.example_command(_comment='I'm a beer-garden comment!',
                                             param_1='example_param')

        Without the leading underscore the arguments would be treated the same as param_1 -
        another parameter to be passed to the plugin.

    :param host: beer-garden REST API hostname.
    :param port: beer-garden REST API port.
    :param system_name: The name of the system to use.
    :param version_constraint: The system version to use. Can be specific or 'latest'.
    :param default_instance: The instance to use if not specified when creating a request.
    :param always_update: Should check for a newer System version before each request.
    :param timeout: Length of time to wait for a request to complete. 'None' means wait forever.
    :param max_delay: Maximum time to wait between checking the status of a created request.
    :param api_version: beer-garden API version.
    :param ssl_enabled: Flag indicating whether to use HTTPS when communicating with beer-garden.
    :param ca_cert: beer-garden REST API server CA certificate.
    :param blocking: Block after request creation until the request completes.
    :param max_concurrent: Maximum number of concurrent requests allowed.
    :param client_cert: The client certificate to use when making requests.
    :param url_prefix: beer-garden REST API URL Prefix.
    :param ca_verify: Flag indicating whether to verify server certificate when making a request.
    :param raise_on_error: Raises an error if the request ends in an error state.
    :param username: Username for Beergarden authentication
    :param password: Password for Beergarden authentication
    :param access_token: Access token for Beergarden authentication
    :param refresh_token: Refresh token for Beergarden authentication
