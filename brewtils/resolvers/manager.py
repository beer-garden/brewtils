    This class is used under-the-hood for various plugin functions. Its purpose is to
    remove all the various cleanup and housekeeping steps involved in resolving
    parameters. An example of an unresolved parameter is a dictionary which represents a
    bytes object. In this case the user wants the open file descriptor, not the random
    dictionary that they don't know how to process. The parameter resolver helps handle
    these scenarios.

    This is intended for internal use for the plugin class.
